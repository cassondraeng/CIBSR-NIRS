# CIBSR-NIRS

This Github repository is for our centralized analysis pipeline for the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research (CIBSR) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) Team at Stanford University (PI: Dr. Allan Reiss). 

We primarily use the NIRS brain AnalyzIR toolbox, a MATLAB based analysis program for NIRS developed and maintained by Dr. Ted Huppert's lab at the University of Pittsburgh http://huppertlab.net/nirs-toolbox-2/ (Santosa et al., 2018) and customized functions tailored for our specific studies.
